			  Dr. Li Li is an ARC DECRA Fellow and Senior Lecturer at Monash University, where he leads the <a href="https://smat-lab.github.io/">SMart software Analysis and Trustworthy computing (SMAT) research lab</a> at the Department of Software Systems and Cybersecurity.
			  He joined <a href="https://www.monash.edu">Monash University</a> as a Lecturer on February 2018. 
			  Prior to that, he was a research associate in Software Engineering at the 
			  <a href="https://wwwen.uni.lu">University of Luxembourg (UL)</a> where he also obtained his Phd degree in November 2016 under the supervision of 
			  <a href="http://wwwen.uni.lu/snt/people/yves_le_traon">Prof. Yves Le Traon (IEEE Fellow)</a> and
			  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jacqueskleinwebpage/">Dr. Jacques Klein</a>.
			  His research interests mainly lie in the field of Mobile Software Engineering (i.e., Mobile Security and quality assurance) and Intelligent Software Engineering (SE4AI, AI4SE), under which 
			  he is broadly interested in applying static code analysis, dynamic program testing, machine/deep learning techniques to strengthen the security and reliability of software systems.
			  
	
			  <br /><br />
			  Li's research has been published in top-tier conferences and journals including ICSE, ESEC/FSE, ASE, ISSTA, POPL, PLDI, TheWebConf, ACL, TOSEM, TSE, TDSC, TIFS.
			  He is recognised as a Rising SE Research Star and one of the Top-5 Most Impactful Early Career SE Researchers in the world (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0164121221001266">2020</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0164121218302334">2017</a>).
			  His research publications have received 5 best/distinguished paper awards, including ACM SIGPLAN Distinguished Paper Award at PLDI 2021 (CORE A*), Best Student Paper Award at TheWebConf 2020 (CORE A*), ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award at ASE 2018 (CORE A*), Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) Impact Paper Award at MSR 2018 (CORE A), and Best Paper Award at the ERA track of SANER 2016 (CORE A).
